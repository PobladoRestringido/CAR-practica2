# How to compile and run code

To compile the code, open a terminal, go to the `build` folder and execute the
following:

`cmake --build .`

Once compiled, move up to the project's root and execute:

`./build/CAR-practica2`

It's important that you **move up** to the root folder before executing, because of
relative paths when opening the dataset images.
